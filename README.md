# Colloquium2016

This project was meant to store the LaTeX files used to create the colloquium poster for the 2016 edition. It has evolved into a more consistent repository with a few [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) designed to prepare figures and illustrations for the Colloquium and that could be re-used for future editions, hopefully.

## Directories

* **figures**: time evolution of the number of received abstracts, spatial distribution of the abstracts and other figures necessary for the poster.
* **latex**: source to create the poster in pdf.
* **logos**: partners and sponsors, necessary for the poster.
* **notebooks**: tools to create the abstract maps and time series.

## Requirements

The notebooks were run using python 2.7. Basic packages were installed for the plotting.

LaTeX: you need to have the fonts Cube-Regular and DINM2 installed in a directory where LaTeX can find them.
