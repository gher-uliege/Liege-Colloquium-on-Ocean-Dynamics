# Colloquium2016

This project was meant to store the LaTeX files used to create the colloquium poster for the 2016 edition. It has evolved into a more consistent repository with a few [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) designed to prepare figures and illustrations for the Colloquium and that could be re-used for future editions, hopefully.

## Directories

* figures: time evolution of the number of received abstracts and spatial distribution of the abstracts.
* logos: partners and sponsors, necessary for the poster.
* notebooks: tools to create the abstract maps and time series.

## Requirements

The notebooks were run using python 2.7. Basic packages were installed for the plotting.
